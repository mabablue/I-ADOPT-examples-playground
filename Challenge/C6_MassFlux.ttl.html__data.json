Vegetation means any living plants e.g. trees, shrubs, grass. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_ process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. The term senescence means loss of living biomass excluding plant death, e.g. leaf drop and other seasonal effects.
